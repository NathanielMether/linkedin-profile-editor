### Models

1. Render out hard coded data
2. Model your data (similar to process in Rails)
3. Add state yo your app
4. Make render use app's state (remove hard-coding from render)
5. Handle events from interactive elements (`onClick`, `onChange`)
6. Connect those to methods that update the app's state (`this.setState`)
